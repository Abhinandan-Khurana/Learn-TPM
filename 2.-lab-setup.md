# 2. Lab Setup

### Ready-to-use docker environment for the labs

[ost2-tpm-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/tpmdev/ost2-tpm-course)

### The software used

[tpm2-tools](http://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools)

[Software TPM](https://github.com/kgoldman/ibmswtpm2)

### Download and run the image

```
docker run --name tpmlab -w ~/lab -it -d --platform=linux/amd64 -e TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=mssim:host=localhost,port=2321 tpmdev/tpm2-runtime:latest
```

Note: Windows users should use -w "/mnt/host/c/Users/WHEREVER/YOUR/LAB/FOLDER" to specify a working folder for docker.

```
docker attach tpmlab
```

### Start the TPM2 simulator

```
tpm_server > tpm.log &
tpm2_startup -c
```

### Verify the lab environment

Generate eight random bytes from the TPM to test that your laboratory environment is working

```
tpm2_getrandom 8 > randombytes
xxd randombytes
```

## (Optional) Using a hardware TPM

## Using a computer with dedicated TPM is possible

These instructions are optional. We recommend using the OST2 TPM docker environment for this course.

### Limitations when using a hardware TPM for training

* Windows TBS restricts access to some TPM functionalities
* MacOS does not have a TPM

### Requirements

* Need to manually install the [tpm2-tss](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss) TPM2 library stack
* Need to manually install the [tpm2-tools](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools)
* May require to configure user permissions for /dev/tpm0
